Lead source: self-serve signup (product-led). Team: CTO (Aisha Kaur), Eng Lead (Mateo Lopez), PM (Rina Shah). Early discovery call 2026-03-02 via Fireflies ff-20260302-0934. Summary: building an in-app conversational assistant for their B2B workflow SaaS; must feel instant (streaming responses) and run on public cloud.

Key requirements:
- Streaming websocket support + chunked tokens (UX requires UI tokens arrive in <50ms increments).
- p50 target ~40-80ms, p95 <120ms, p99 <200ms for short responses (avg 60 tokens).
- Concurrent active users at launch ~100-200, expected steady-state 20-50.
- Cost-sensitive: want guidance on batching vs streaming tradeoffs and token/unit price impact.
- Model preferences: prefer smaller fast open models for latency (we mentioned quantized Llama-family / Mistral-lite), but open to Redwood verified models for throughput.
- Security: SOC2 on roadmap, need SSO (SAML) + audit logging for partner beta.

POC/workflow discussed:
- They used free credits to wire up a quick websocket chat to Redwood hosted API. Observed good tail latencies but worried about unit cost when scaling. Did a smoke test with ~50 concurrent short chats (avg reply length 60 tokens) — saw 120ms median, 250ms p99 in one run.
- Interested in Redwood Optimize suggestions (batching hints, prefix caching) to reduce cost without hurting streaming UX.

Quotes / call notes (shorthand):
- "Streaming must feel instant — if agents lag, users drop off." — Aisha (CTO).
- "We need a clear cost model for streaming usage; tickets are tight for first 6 months." — Mateo (Eng Lead).

Timeline & activities: see activity_timeline field for discrete items.

Risk / next-stage signals: if we can show a predictable cost/latency plan and a simple SSO flow, they'll move to a 3-month paid pilot and open a dedicated usage seat in April.
