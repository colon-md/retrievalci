Develop interactive tone derivatives and Kappa elevation scale for data grids

Objective: Create a deterministic system for producing interactive color derivatives (hover/focus/pressed/disabled) from the base semantic palette and introduce a physics-inspired elevation scale ("Kappa") tuned for dense data surfaces such as DataGrid, compact tables, and inline action bars.

Scope:
- Define algorithmic transforms to derive interactive tones from semantic base tokens (primary, neutral, success, caution, critical). The transforms must preserve WCAG contrast for actionable states and offer predictable deltas for designers and engineers.
- Introduce a Kappa elevation token family (kappa-0..kappa-6) with mapped umbra/penumbra/ambient values and matching colorized overlays for dark/light themes optimized for high-density rows.
- Propose spacing/radius adjustments for compact rows to align with new elevation cues while retaining hit-target accessibility.
- Update Figma token library and token spec (CSS vars + JSON token artifacts) and provide migration guidance for DataGrid, Table, Button, and InlineAction components.

Goals & Acceptance criteria:
1) Token spec: produce a stable token spec file (design JSON) that includes base palette, interactive derivatives (e.g., color.interactive.primary.hover), and elevation.kappa.{0..6} with explicit shadow parameters.
2) Implementation-ready: frontend repo receives a tokens PR implementing variables; DataGrid and Table components consume new tokens behind a feature flag.
3) Accessibility: automated contrast checks pass for all interactive states against 3:1 where applicable and 4.5:1 for primary actionable text.
4) Visual regression: add per-component visual snapshots and tolerances; no regressions beyond approved deltas.
5) Figma: updated design kit with tokenized components and guidance notes.
6) Rollout plan: canary on internal analytics dashboards -> staged rollout -> full migration with a fallback.

Design notes and trade-offs:
- Algorithmic derivation reduces token sprawl (fewer manual swatches) but requires deterministic tuning. We will prefer per-hue perceptual adjustments (Lab-space tweaks) over fixed lightness deltas to avoid color shifts across hues.
- Kappa elevation prioritizes subtle penumbra for dense rows; larger elevations are intentionally muted to avoid visual clutter. This might reduce perceived separation in extreme cases; provide an override token for high-contrast surfaces.
- Implementation should use runtime CSS variables for quick theming and a build-time compiled fallback for older clients. There are performance trade-offs when shipping many tokens; we will group tokens under semantic prefixes to keep runtime size manageable.

Migration plan:
1) Finalize tokens in design JSON and Figma (this ticket).
2) Engineered tokens PR (feature-flagged).
3) Update DataGrid/Table to read tokens; create opt-in toggle for compact Kappa mode.
4) Run automated visual diffs and accessibility scans.
5) QA and UAT with PM/Analytics team, then canary-release on internal dashboards for 2 weeks before full rollout.

2026-03-02 - Ava Martinez: Created initial spec draft and seeded Figma file 'kappa-elevation-explorations'. Requesting engineering feasibility review for CSS variable strategy.
2026-03-05 - Jun Park: Engineering review notes: prefer CSS custom properties with a compiled JSON fallback. Concern about runtime token count; propose grouping under --r-token-* and lazy-loading theme bundles.
2026-03-08 - Alex Chen (Accessibility): Ran preliminary contrast tests on automatic derivation heuristics. Primary hover needed minor adjustment to meet 4.5:1 on 14px text; suggested increasing delta on low-chroma primaries.
2026-03-10 - Design critique: Decided to implement derivation in Lab space and expose a per-hue microdelta table for edge-case tuning. Agreed on kappa range 0..6 where 0 = flat and 6 = modest lift for modal headers only.
2026-03-12 - Jun Park: Frontend spike completed. Implemented a prototype token loader and a DataGrid feature flag that toggles compact-kappa mode. Performance impact negligible in dev build; need production smoke test.
2026-03-14 - PM review (Riya Patel): Approved rollout plan pending a short canary run. Asked to add telemetry for token usage and a regression alert to detect visual drift > 6% pixel change.
2026-03-15 - Next steps: finish Figma kit annotations, author tokens PR, add visual snapshots for DataGrid/Table, schedule canary for 2026-03-22.
Follow-up tasks: Create engineering ticket to add a 'kappa-override' opt-out for high-contrast themes; capture benchmark metrics after canary.
Note: Keep a migration branch and rollback playbook in case third-party dashboards rely on previous elevation semantics.
