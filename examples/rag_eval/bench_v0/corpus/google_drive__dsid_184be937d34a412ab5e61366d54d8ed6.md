Draft Spec: Policy Engine Extensions for Regional Failover Automation

Context / why this exists
- We’re upgrading regional failover automation as part of Reliability Program (Q1–Q2 2026). Today, routing policy evaluation has a few gaps:
  - Non-deterministic behavior in edge cases (e.g., multiple signals firing, partial signal availability, time-window ambiguity).
  - Hard to reason about priority across trigger signals (reachability, 5xx burn, tail latency burn, capacity exhaustion).
  - No first-class “hold-down” / dampening in evaluation; logic is split between policy rules and external controller.
  - No consistent mechanism to enforce safety constraints per tenant/tier (max flips, blast radius caps, required approval).

Goals
- Add policy engine primitives so failover decisioning is:
  - Deterministic and auditable (same inputs => same decision; explainability built-in).
  - Compatible with ADR-042 (signal priority + corroboration) and ADR-043 (rollback + anti-flap).
  - Safe by default (rate limits, required corroboration, blast radius constraints).
- Support both:
  - “Recommend” (dry-run) mode: compute candidate flips + evidence.
  - “Enforce” mode: same evaluation but returns executable actions.

Non-goals
- Replace the automation controller. The controller still orchestrates execution, approvals, and cross-system workflow.
- Re-architect signal ingestion. We consume normalized, time-bucketed signals from Region Health + SLO toolkit.
- Build customer-facing UI here.

Terminology
- Policy: configuration describing routing behavior for a route/service/model/tier.
- Region set: primary and fallback regions eligible for this route.
- Trigger signal: normalized boolean or scalar indicating regional impairment or risk.
- Decision: computed outcome (no-op, failover, partial shift, rollback, hold).
- Action: executable change (policy flip, weight adjustment, circuit breaker mode) emitted by controller.

Inputs / data model assumptions
- Policy engine receives inputs as a single evaluation payload, including:
  - route_id (e.g., hosted.chat.completions, dedicated.pool.<pool_id>)
  - tenant_id (optional for shared Hosted; required for Dedicated)
  - tenant_tier (free/pro/enterprise/dedicated)
  - current_routing_state (primary region, weights, last_flip_at)
  - signals (per region, per signal type):
    - reachability: ok|degraded|down + confidence + last_updated
    - errors_5xx_burn: burn_rate + window + confidence
    - tail_latency_burn: burn_rate + p95/p99 deltas + confidence
    - capacity_headroom: percent + “hard gate” boolean
    - control_plane_health (optional): ok|degraded|down
  - evaluation_time (UTC epoch + monotonic sequence)
  - constraints (policy-level + tenant-level): max_flips_per_hour, min_hold_down_seconds, require_approval, blast_radius_limit

Determinism requirements (core)
1) Stable ordering
- Evaluation must not depend on map iteration order.
- Rule matching must define explicit ordering: by priority, then by tie-breakers.

2) Stable time semantics
- All windowed signals must be anchored to evaluation_time and include:
  - effective_start, effective_end, and a “freshness” timestamp.
- Engine must treat stale signals consistently:
  - If authoritative signals are stale beyond threshold, decision = HOLD (do not fail over) unless reachability is explicitly DOWN with high confidence.

3) Single decision per evaluation
- For a given (route_id, tenant_id, evaluation_time), engine emits exactly one decision object, even if multiple actions are possible.
- Multi-step actions (e.g., drain -> shift weights -> finalize) must be represented as a sequence recommendation but still within a single decision record.

4) Explainability
- Decision must include:
  - decision_type (NO_OP | FAILOVER | PARTIAL_SHIFT | ROLLBACK | HOLD)
  - chosen_reason (canonical enum)
  - evidence: ordered list of signals used, with values, freshness, and thresholds.
  - rejected_candidates: (optional) top 1–3 alternatives and why they were not selected.

Proposed changes to policy engine
A) New predicates / functions
1) region_health(region, signal_type) -> {status, value, confidence, freshness_seconds}
- Wrapper that pulls normalized data from payload and enforces freshness calculations.

2) is_authoritative_reachability_down(region) -> bool
- True only if:
  - reachability.status == down
  - confidence >= configured_min_confidence (default 0.9)
  - freshness_seconds <= reachability_max_staleness (default 30s)

3) burn_rate_exceeded(region, metric, window, threshold) -> bool
- Works for errors_5xx_burn and tail_latency_burn.
- Window must be one of approved windows (e.g., 1m/5m/30m) to avoid configuration drift.

4) capacity_hard_gate(region) -> bool
- True if headroom below threshold AND capacity signal confidence is high.
- Intended to prevent shifting into an already overloaded region.

5) corroborated(primary_signal, secondary_signal) -> bool
- Enforces ADR-042 “required corroboration signals” when configured.
- Example: if tail latency burn triggers, require either 5xx burn OR reachability degraded/down OR control plane degraded.

6) hold_down_active(last_flip_at, min_hold_down_seconds) -> bool
- If true, policy engine returns HOLD unless reachability down is authoritative.

7) flip_budget_ok(tenant_id, route_id, max_flips_per_hour) -> bool
- Input includes a precomputed counter from controller/state store (policy engine does not store state).

8) blast_radius_ok(tenant_tier, requested_action) -> bool
- Enforces “can’t shift more than X% traffic for tier Y without approval”.
- For Hosted, blast radius is route-scoped; for Dedicated, pool-scoped.

B) Deterministic evaluation mode (required)
- Add an “evaluation_mode” field:
  - recommend: compute decision + evidence; do not mark as executable
  - enforce: compute decision; include explicit requested_action(s)
- Engine must produce identical decision_type and evidence in both modes (action packaging differs).

C) Signal hierarchy evaluation (ADR-042)
Priority order (proposed canonical order for v1):
1) Reachability DOWN (authoritative) => FAILOVER (unless no healthy fallback)
2) Errors (5xx) fast burn (high severity) => FAILOVER or PARTIAL_SHIFT depending on blast radius and capacity
3) Tail latency burn (p99/p95) => PARTIAL_SHIFT first; escalate to FAILOVER if corroborated and sustained
4) Capacity exhaustion / hard gate => HOLD + load shed (controller action), avoid shifting into constrained region
5) Control plane degradation => HOLD (do not flip rapidly; prevent oscillation)

Notes:
- “No healthy fallback” means every eligible fallback region fails capacity_hard_gate OR reachability is down OR stale beyond threshold.
- If no healthy fallback, decision should be HOLD and include “degrade_allowed=true” hint (controller can activate load shedding / retry-after).

D) Policy language / config schema additions
Add new fields (names tentative):
- failover:
  - enabled: boolean
  - eligible_regions: [us-east, eu-west, ...]
  - signal_requirements:
    - primary_trigger: enum
    - corroboration: [enum]
    - min_confidence: float
    - max_staleness_seconds: int
  - dampening:
    - min_hold_down_seconds: int
    - require_sustain_seconds: int (for non-reachability triggers)
  - safety:
    - require_approval: boolean (default true for prod initially)
    - max_flips_per_hour: int
    - max_traffic_shift_percent: int
    - rollback:
      - auto_rollback_enabled: boolean
      - rollback_after_seconds: int
      - rollback_require_healthy_primary_seconds: int

E) Output schema
Decision output (single object, JSON):
- decision_id (stable hash of route_id + tenant_id + evaluation_time + policy_version)
- policy_version
- evaluation_time
- decision_type
- chosen_reason
- target_state (string encoding; owned by controller)
- requested_actions (string encoding; empty in recommend mode)
- evidence (string encoding; ordered)
- annotations (string encoding; includes thresholds, staleness, hold-down state)

Note: In our implementation we’ll likely use structured objects, but for logging/audit we must generate a stable, versioned string representation.

Safety constraints (ADR-043 alignment)
- Anti-flap:
  - Enforce hold-down between flips for non-reachability triggers.
  - Any rollback decision must respect a separate rollback hold-down (avoid ping-pong between primary and fallback).
- Rate limiting:
  - flip_budget_ok must be true, else HOLD.
- Approval hooks:
  - If require_approval is true, decision_type can still be FAILOVER but requested_actions must be empty and “approval_required=true” annotation set.
- Tenant/tier gates:
  - Enterprise/Dedicated can be configured with stricter “do not cross data residency boundary” constraint (policy engine should surface “constraint_violation:data_residency” rather than attempt partial shifts).

Edge cases and expected behavior
1) Partial outage in primary region
- Reachability degraded (not down), 5xx burn elevated, capacity OK in fallback.
- Expected: PARTIAL_SHIFT (e.g., shift 25–50% depending on max_traffic_shift_percent) if corroborated. If sustained and escalates to reachability down or error burn becomes severe => FAILOVER.

2) Signal missing / ingestion delayed
- Any authoritative signal is stale beyond max_staleness_seconds.
- Expected: HOLD. Evidence must explicitly call out staleness and which signal blocked action.

3) Fallback region constrained
- Primary is failing (5xx burn), fallback capacity_hard_gate true.
- Expected: HOLD + annotate “fallback_unhealthy_due_to_capacity”. Controller should invoke load shedding and retry-after rather than shifting load.

4) Control plane degraded
- Control plane health degraded; data plane signals ambiguous.
- Expected: HOLD unless reachability down is authoritative. (Avoid flipping policies when control plane is suspect.)

5) Multi-fallback selection
- If multiple eligible fallback regions are healthy, selection tie-breakers:
  1) policy-specified order
  2) lowest latency probe (if available in inputs)
  3) highest capacity headroom
  4) stable sort by region name

Testing plan (draft)
Unit tests
- Determinism:
  - Same payload with randomized key order => same decision_id, decision_type, evidence ordering.
- Staleness gating:
  - Stale error burn + fresh reachability OK => HOLD.
- Priority:
  - Reachability DOWN overrides hold-down.
  - 5xx burn overrides latency burn when both exceed thresholds.

Integration tests
- Replay recorded signal snapshots from staging incidents + controlled game day traces.
- Validate output is compatible with controller dry-run UX (must contain reasons + evidence).

Performance considerations
- Evaluation must be cheap; do not add per-eval remote calls.
- Evidence strings must be bounded in size. Cap rejected_candidates and evidence list.

Operational / observability hooks
- Emit a single log line per decision with:
  - decision_id, route_id, tenant_id (hashed in shared Hosted contexts), decision_type, chosen_reason
  - key thresholds and freshness
- Export metrics:
  - policy_engine_decisions_total{decision_type, chosen_reason, tier}
  - policy_engine_hold_reasons_total{reason}
  - policy_engine_eval_latency_ms

Open questions
- Exact shape of “target_state” string: should it be a controller-owned serialization of desired weights, or should the policy engine output high-level intent only?
- Do we want PARTIAL_SHIFT as a first-class decision type (recommended), or represent it as FAILOVER with weight < 100%?
- How strict should corroboration be for tail latency burn? (ADR-042 indicates corroboration required; we need the exact default set.)
- Where should data residency constraints live?
  - Option A: policy engine validates “region set allowed” and blocks action.
  - Option B: upstream policy compilation prevents invalid eligible_regions.

Near-term next steps
- Align with Miles/Ravi on canonical signal enum + reason enum.
- Draft schema PR for policy config additions (behind feature flag).
- Implement deterministic ordering + evidence output in policy engine.
- Wire to dry-run mode (ENG-2415) so the controller can display “recommended action + confidence + evidence” on game day.
