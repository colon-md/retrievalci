Prompt heuristics experiments scratchpad

Goal: quick notes & experiment ledger for prompt heuristics — build a small library of templates + failure cases to iterate with the hosted API. Mostly personal, messy, includes raw outputs, TODOs.

Context / motivation:
- Want robust few-shot templates for short instruction tasks (classification, extractive QA, rewrite).
- Observed instability across temperature and ordering; need heuristics that generalize across models and quantization variants.
- Start from pragmatic rules rather than huge eval harness.

High-level heuristics I want to test (hypotheses):
1) Explicit role + short constraint outperform long rationale priming for 1–3 shot tasks under latency budgets.
2) Putting the positive example(s) first then the negative(s) reduces hallucination in binary classification.
3) Using tag tokens (### EXAMPLE) helps when using streaming responses because model learns block boundaries.
4) For extraction tasks, prefer “Return as JSON: {key:value}” templates to avoid verbose paraphrases.

Experiment matrix (fast runs):
- Model: small/medium/large (toy runs on gpt-small / gpt-medium / gpt-large-like) — use hosted dev creds.
- Temp: 0.0, 0.2, 0.7
- Few-shot count: 0, 1, 3
- Example ordering: positive-first, negative-first, mixed
- Priming style: role-only vs role + example explanation vs role + chain-of-thought
- Output constraint: plain text vs JSON vs YAML-like

Quick templates to copy/paste (placeholders in <>):
Template A — role + JSON extraction (1-shot):
"""
You are a concise extractor. Given text, return JSON with keys: product, price, quantity.
Example:
Text: "Bought 3 packs of AA batteries (Model X) for $9.99 each
"
Output: {"product":"AA batteries (Model X)", "price":"9.99", "quantity":"3"}

Now extract from the input below:
Text: "<INPUT_TEXT>"
"""

Template B — classification with tag separators (3-shot):
"""
You are a brief classifier. Use labels: {POSITIVE, NEGATIVE}.
### EXAMPLE
Input: "Loved the service, will come back!"
Label: POSITIVE
### EXAMPLE
Input: "Item arrived broken and no reply from support."
Label: NEGATIVE
### EXAMPLE
Input: "Average experience, shipping slow but product ok."
Label: NEGATIVE

Now classify:
Input: "<INPUT>"
Label:
"""

Template C — rewrite to tone (zero-shot with instructions):
"""
You are a rewrite assistant. Rewrite the following customer message to be formal and concise (one sentence).
Message: "<MSG>"
Rewritten:
"""

Few-shot set examples used in the notebook (raw):
- EX1 classification positive: "Service was amazing, staff helpful." -> POSITIVE
- EX2 classification negative: "Order missing items, support unhelpful." -> NEGATIVE
- EX3 extraction (invoice-like): "Invoice 552: 5 widgets @ $2.50 each" -> {product: widgets, price: 2.50, quantity: 5}

Observed failure cases (logs, raw snippets):
1) Extraction fails on currency symbols -> model returns "$2.50" instead of normalized number when temp>0.
   - Example input: "Total: $12.00"
   - Output: {price: "$12.00"} (bad) vs expected {price: "12.00"}.
2) Classification flip when first example is negative (3-shot):
   - Ordering negative-first -> model labels borderline positive text as NEGATIVE 45% of trials at temp=0.2.
3) Streaming truncation glue: when examples use long explanations, streaming token boundary cutting can produce malformed JSON (missing closing brace).
4) Chain-of-thought contamination: if we include a short explanation after examples, sometimes model replicates the internal reasoning in the final output (not desirable for downstream parsers).

Mini-results notes (quick manual runs, counts are small N=20 per cell):
- Temp=0.0 + JSON constraint -> extraction normalized numbers 89% correct
- Temp=0.2 + role-only -> classification accuracy 82% (pos/neg); adding short example explanations drops to 75% (more variance)
- 3-shot vs 1-shot: marginal lift (~3 points) but increased hallucination in extractive tasks when examples are too verbose.

Debug examples (copied outputs):
Input: "Bought 3x AA battery pack (Model B), $7.25 each"
Template A (temp 0.2) -> {"product":"3x AA battery pack (Model B)", "price":"$7.25", "quantity":"3"}
Notes: price contains $; want normalized. Hack: post-process strip non-digits. But better: prompt explicitly: "Return price as digits only (e.g. 7.25)".

Ordering experiment quick log:
- positive-first, temp=0.0, accuracy=86%
- negative-first, temp=0.0, accuracy=78%
- mixed, temp=0.2, accuracy=80%
Takeaway: positive-first seems slightly more stable for balanced tasks.

Ideas to try next (short list):
- Force format tokens: wrap JSON in <OUTPUT>...</OUTPUT> tags to reduce streaming truncation parsing issues.
- Minimal examples: keep examples to <50 tokens each for extraction tasks.
- Prepend a one-line canonicalization instruction: "When extracting prices, strip currency symbols and return decimals only." Test whether model obeys more than post-processing.
- Try injected parsing hint: "Return EXACT JSON, no extra keys or explanation." See effect on refusals/hallucination.

Edge cases to capture in eval set (small):
- multiple currencies in one text
- shorthand numbers (1k, 2M) -> normalize? decide policy
- ambiguous quantity words (a dozen, several) -> map to unknown or approximate?

Open questions / unresolved:
- Is there a general rule for example ordering across task families or is it task-specific? Need more systematic N.
- How much does tokenization/quantization (int8 vs int4) affect these behaviors? Evan suggested running one sweep on ded-quantized nodes.
- Are tag tokens worthwhile for large-scale streaming workloads? Small overhead but possibly reduces hallucination—cost tradeoff unknown.

Quick TODOs (prioritized):
- [ ] Automate N=50 runs for ordering x temp for one classification dataset (Priya to help) — LINK ticket REDW-4821.
- [ ] Add canonicalization line to Template A and test N=100 on hosted dev region (low cost).
- [ ] Prototype <OUTPUT> tag wrapper and test streaming truncation failures (Evan).
- [ ] Capture examples where model returns extra keys (e.g., adds "currency":"USD") and decide whether to reject or accept.

Notes-to-self: keep prompts short, explicit, and machine-friendly for parsing. Avoid chain-of-thought inside examples unless the task benefits (creative tasks). Log everything — small manual runs are noisy but surfaced a lot of concrete failure modes.

End of scratchpad (still messy).
