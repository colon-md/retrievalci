Subject: Critical: sudden latency spike and 500s on inference endpoints

Hi Stephanie,

We started seeing a large increase in end-to-end latency and a burst of 5xx errors on the /v1/generate endpoint at ~07:55 PDT. Throughput dropped by ~40% for our primary production inference queue and several batches timed out. This is causing timeouts in our user-facing flow and triggering throttles on our side.

Symptoms observed: 
- Median latency jumped from ~120ms to ~900ms between 07:55–08:05
- 500 responses: ~8% of requests in the window
- Throughput fall from 250 req/s to ~150 req/s for the Crucible production key

We attached recent logs (request IDs included) and a CSV snapshot of KPIs. Please escalate — this is blocking a critical demo at 10:00 PDT.

Sample request IDs: 6a4f9b2c, 6a4f9b45, 6a4f9c01

Team — forwarding urgent customer report from Crucible Health (Julia).

Quick asks: 
1) Marcus, can infra/serving triage immediately (metrics + recent deploys + autoscaler behavior)?
2) Hannah, please own customer comms and schedule an executive sync at 09:00 PDT. They have a demo at 10:00 and want any mitigation now.
3) Laura / Sergio, finance/econ may need to approve priority capacity if we recommend burst dedicated capacity.

I attached the logs Julia sent. Will coordinate a brief 30-min sync once Marcus confirms an ops hypothesis.

Looking at the log snippet and metrics in the linked Drive: two quick hypotheses — autoscaler oscillation under sudden burst + one failing shard (GPU OOM or degraded kernel) causing head-of-line blocking.

Immediate actions I can kick off now: 
- Push an emergency scale to the dedicated pool serving Crucible (add +20% capacity) and temporarily increase max concurrency limits to reduce queueing.
- Route new requests to the 2ndary model variant (same family, lower context) as an immediate fallback to reduce per-token work.
- Isolate problematic instance(s) and drain to avoid repeated 5xx.

I requested the SRE-run to execute scale and are running a quick health sweep across nodes for OOMs and kernel failures. ETA for first measurable improvement: ~8–12 minutes after scale.

I'll post an ops note to the Jira incident (INC-9821) and attach a short action plan.

Thanks — I'm on comms. Stephanie, please send the short external status below by 08:50 PDT. I'll run the 09:00 exec sync and include Marcus for the technical update.

Proposed external update to send to Julia (short):
Hi Julia — we see the spike and have enacted emergency scaling and a fallback routing policy. We expect measurable latency reduction within ~10 minutes and will reconvene with a full status at 09:00 PDT. Apologies for the disruption; prioritizing now.

We should open a temporary SLA exception window and offer demo support. Laura, can we greenlight priority burst capacity billing for this account pending postmortem?

Subject: Update: Redwood is actively mitigating the latency issue (ETA ~10m)

Hi Julia / Ravi — quick update from Redwood: 

- We see the anomaly and have enacted emergency scaling for your dedicated pool; SRE is draining a suspected degraded instance.
- We have enabled a fallback routing policy that will send new traffic to a compatible model variant with lower context length to reduce tail latency.
- Marcus estimates 8–12 minutes for a measurable improvement. We will join a 09:00 PDT exec sync to share full context and next steps.

We appreciate the heads-up — we're treating this as high priority. I'll be on the 09:00 sync and will keep you updated in the thread.

Thanks Stephanie — appreciate the fast response. We'll stand by for the 09:00 PDT update and let our demo team know the mitigations are in flight.

Subject: Incident update & postmortem summary — latency spike (INC-9821)

All — final update from the investigation and mitigation performed yesterday. Summary: 

Root cause: A recently deployed autoscaler policy update combined with a rare kernel failure on a single GPU instance produced cascading queue pressure; autoscaler oscillation and a lag in instance replacement led to transient 5xxs and reduced throughput. The failing instance also intermittently returned degraded kernel performance which amplified tail latency.

What we did: 
- Emergency capacity bump and routing to fallback model variant on 2026-08-28 at 08:28 PDT — immediate tail-latency improved and throughput returned to baseline within ~12 minutes.
- Drained and reprovisioned the failing instance; patched the kernel path in the affected image and rolled a hotfix to prevent identical failures.
- Reverted the autoscaler policy update and introduced a short cool-down to prevent oscillation.

Impact: 
- Customer observed peak 5xx rate of 8% and throughput drop to ~60% of baseline for a ~10-minute window. No customer data exfiltration.

Next steps / action items: 
1) We will publish a short postmortem to the customer by EOD with the timeline and mitigations (Hannah + Stephanie).
2) Engineering (Marcus) to harden autoscaler policy testing and add a canary step for autoscaler changes.
3) Product to add a routing knob for immediate cross-model fallback triggered by SLA breach (Marcus + Product).
4) Finance to confirm priority-burst billing terms for this incident (Laura).

Thanks everyone for the quick triage. Julia — we are sending a tailored postmortem and are happy to run a joint technical review next week if you'd like.
