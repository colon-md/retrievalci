Sliced ingest 429s on dedicated pool after migration — priority class + burst pool debug notes (Streamly AI)

Context / why this doc exists
- This is a working scratchpad for SRE/Eng while debugging Streamly AI’s sustained 429s during sliced ingest after dedicated pool migration.
- Source ticket: SUP-864999 (customer-support). This doc is meant to be the “newer truth” vs the older ticket narrative since we’ve learned more post-call + after patch testing.

Customer + impact recap (same as ticket, but condensed)
- Customer: Streamly AI (dedicated tier)
- Environment: prod us-west, dedicated pool dp-132-usw
- Traffic mix:
  - Interactive: short chat calls (priority=high)
  - Background: multipart embedding uploads (priority=background/low) with signed URL chunk completion callbacks
- Observed on 2026-03-10 ~09:00–11:30 PDT:
  - ~30% of short chat requests returned 429 coincident with the scheduled bulk ingest flush
  - Customer saw retry amplification and user-visible errors

Versions / components
- Dedicated pool: dp-132-usw
- Ingest coordinator version (at time of incident): 2026.02.3
- Rate-limiter version (at time of incident): 1.14.0-canary
- Edge / API gateway involved due to opaque 429 behavior (missing headers)

Symptoms (what we saw)
- Persistent 429s for /v1/chat during background upload ramp.
- Throttle headers when present indicated per-route window exhaustion.
- A subset of 429s were “opaque” (no X-RateLimit headers) especially during callback fanout peaks.

Example log snippets (from ticket; kept here for reference)
- 2026-03-10T09:02:14Z - 200 - /v1/chat - key=acct-streamly-01 - latency=62ms
- 2026-03-10T09:02:19Z - 429 - /v1/chat - key=acct-streamly-01 - throttle: route_window=0/100
- 2026-03-10T09:02:20Z - 429 - /v1/embed - key=acct-streamly-01 - chunk=12/20 - err=quota_exhausted
- 2026-03-10T09:05:01Z - 429 - /v1/chat - key=acct-streamly-01 - no-rate-headers (opaque)

Steps to reproduce (traffic shape)
1) 100 concurrent short chat requests (avg 50ms) + 20 parallel multipart embedding uploads (avg 45s each).
2) Route both traffic shapes through dp-132-usw with priority classes: interactive=high, background=low.
3) Start background uploads in tight window (cron-style flush ~09:00 local).
4) Observe interactive 429s during the first 20–40 minutes of background ramp.

What changed vs initial hypothesis (updated findings)
- Initial hypothesis in SUP-864999: “priority class mismatch / weight inversion in 1.14.0-canary allows background to borrow interactive burst credits under certain attach sequences.”
- Updated after deeper review (2026-03-13 to 2026-03-20):
  - There are TWO overlapping issues:
    (A) Rate-limiter burst-pool attach race (real) that can temporarily mis-attribute available burst credits across pools.
    (B) Edge proxy early-return path under backpressure causing missing X-RateLimit headers and (worse) collapsing distinct upstream 429 reasons into a single opaque 429 surface.
  - The attach race (A) increases the probability that interactive tokens are temporarily depleted during the exact window when callback fanout is max.
  - The edge behavior (B) makes it look like “random 429s” and prevents the customer from applying correct retry/backoff logic.

Root cause (current best explanation)
- A burst-pool weight recalculation occurs on route attach to a dedicated pool.
- Under high fanout (multipart chunk completion callbacks + interactive requests), an attach sequence can read stale bucket state and allow background borrow to temporarily draw from the interactive pool’s credits.
- Separately, when the edge proxy is under callback-related backpressure, it can return 429 before the normal header-enrichment path runs, producing opaque 429s.

Mitigations applied / tested (new since ticket)
Temporary customer-facing workaround (still valid)
- Stagger background multipart uploads and add jitter to the flush window.
- Reduce background upload concurrency (Streamly tested <= 6 workers) during peak interactive usage.

Config change (applied on 2026-03-12 call)
- On dp-132-usw we reserved burst capacity explicitly for interactive routes.
- Updated reservation target: reserve 30% (previous internal suggestion was 20%) of interactive burst credits exclusively for priority=high routes.
- Also separated the route groups so callbacks cannot share the same per-route window as interactive endpoints.

Patch status (updated)
- Rate-limiter fix was originally tracked as “target 1.14.1”.
- As of 2026-03-19: fix is in 1.14.1-rc2 and deployed to canary in us-west dedicated pools (including dp-132-usw) for validation.
- Early results: eliminates the negative token deltas we were seeing during attach bursts; interactive 429 rate decreased materially during the flush window.

Results from customer validation (new)
- 2026-03-12 (trial during scheduled flush):
  - Interactive error rate improved; remaining 429s clustered around callback spikes.
  - Customer confirmed jitter reduced the “all-at-once” failure mode.
- 2026-03-20 (post 1.14.1-rc2 canary + reserved burst config still in place):
  - No sustained 429s for /v1/chat during the 09:00–10:00 window.
  - A few 429s remain on background /v1/embed chunk callbacks (expected; acceptable if retried with backoff).

Open questions / TODO
- Edge proxy: ensure X-RateLimit headers are emitted even under backpressure for 429s originating from rate-limiter.
- Confirm whether signed URL callback endpoints should be assigned their own priority class (e.g., “callback-low”) distinct from generic background.
- Add a regression test: attach burst + high fanout + two priority classes should never allow cross-pool borrow that depletes interactive tokens.

Recommended next steps (updated plan)
1) Keep the reserved interactive burst split (30%) for dedicated pools with mixed interactive + bulk ingest traffic.
2) Promote rate-limiter 1.14.1 from rc to stable after 48h canary observation (watch: rlim.route.tokens.available deltas, interactive 429 rate, attach timing).
3) Edge proxy change: always populate rate-limit headers (or at least a stable error code) for 429s; avoid “opaque 429”.
4) Update the support playbook page with explicit guidance for signed URL callback fanout (jitter + concurrency caps + route separation).
5) Schedule a controlled load test with Streamly AI for 3 consecutive peak windows and collect traces + request IDs for closure criteria.

Notes / timeline crumbs (for internal use)
- 2026-03-10: incident window; strong correlation with cron flush.
- 2026-03-11: Eng suspected weight inversion / attach sequence sensitivity.
- 2026-03-12: customer call; implemented burst reservation + client-side jitter.
- 2026-03-19: 1.14.1-rc2 canary deployed to us-west dedicated.
- 2026-03-20: customer reports no sustained interactive 429s during flush.

Closure criteria (for SUP-864999)
- Interactive endpoints (/v1/chat) see <0.1% 429 during scheduled flush windows for 3 consecutive days.
- Any remaining 429s are limited to background endpoints and include consistent headers / error codes enabling correct retry behavior.
