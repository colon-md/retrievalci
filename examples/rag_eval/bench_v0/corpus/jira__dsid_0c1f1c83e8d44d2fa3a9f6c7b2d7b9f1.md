Crucible Health: inference latency spike + transient 5xx on /v1/generate (INC-9821)

Customer escalation relayed by Stephanie Nguyen. Crucible Health reported sudden latency spike and burst of 5xx on inference endpoint /v1/generate beginning ~2026-08-28 07:55 PDT. Reported impact: median latency increased from ~120ms to ~900ms; throughput dropped from ~250 req/s to ~150 req/s for Crucible production key; initial customer-observed 5xx rate ~8% during the window; multiple batches timed out and downstream throttles triggered. Customer had a critical demo at 10:00 PDT.

Immediate hypotheses (serving): autoscaler oscillation under burst + degraded single shard causing head-of-line blocking.

Immediate mitigations executed: emergency scale-up of dedicated pool (target +20% capacity) + temporary concurrency limit increase + drain suspected bad instance(s) + enable routing of new requests to compatible fallback model variant (lower context) to reduce per-token work.

Outcome (updated after investigation): improvements observed within ~9–12 minutes; throughput returned to baseline and tail latency normalized after draining the degraded node(s) and reverting autoscaler policy.

Updated root cause (post-incident): the triggering event was an autoscaler policy update that reduced stabilization/cooldown and interacted poorly with a burst in queue depth, causing scale oscillation. One GPU instance concurrently entered a degraded driver state (intermittent kernel launch stalls rather than a hard OOM), amplifying tail latency and increasing request timeouts which surfaced as 5xx at the gateway. The instance replacement lag plus oscillation extended the incident duration.

Impact (finalized): peak 5xx rate revised to ~6–8% (varied by minute) with ~10–12 minute period of elevated errors; throughput dipped to ~60% of baseline at trough. No evidence of data integrity or security issues.
2026-08-28 (Stephanie Nguyen): Forwarded urgent report from Crucible. Asks: infra/serving triage immediately; CS to own comms + schedule exec sync 09:00 PDT; finance to pre-approve priority burst capacity if needed. Customer attachments: request_logs_20260828.zip, detailed_kpi_snapshot.csv.
2026-08-28 (Marcus Lin): Initial hypotheses: autoscaler oscillation under sudden burst + failing shard causing head-of-line blocking. Immediate actions: emergency scale dedicated pool (+20%), temporarily increase max concurrency, route new requests to secondary model variant (lower context), isolate/drain problematic instance(s). ETA for measurable improvement: ~8–12 minutes after scale. Will update INC-9821.
2026-08-28 (Hannah Schmitt): On comms. Proposed external update: mitigation in flight; expect improvement within ~10 minutes; reconvene 09:00 PDT. Requested temporary SLA exception window + demo support. Asked finance to greenlight burst billing pending postmortem.
2026-08-28 (Stephanie Nguyen -> customer): Sent external update: emergency scaling, drain suspected degraded instance, fallback routing enabled. Set expectation of measurable improvement in 8–12 minutes and 09:00 PDT exec sync.
2026-08-29 (Marcus Lin): Investigation summary shared internally/with customer on thread: reverted autoscaler policy update; added cooldown to prevent oscillation; drained/reprovisioned affected instance; hotfix to prevent recurrence. Impact noted as ~8% peak 5xx and ~10 minute window. Action items: customer postmortem by EOD; harden autoscaler testing + canary for autoscaler changes; product routing knob for rapid cross-model fallback; finance confirm priority-burst billing terms.
2026-09-01 (Marcus Lin): Correction after deeper node telemetry review: primary node issue was intermittent driver/kernel launch stalls (no sustained OOM). Updated remediation: rolled new base image + added driver health-check gate to remove degraded nodes faster; autoscaler change now includes 30m canary + enforced cooldown floor. Linked PRs: serving-runtime#18422 (health gate + faster eviction), infra-autoscaler#771 (cooldown floor + canary checklist).
2026-09-03 (Stephanie Nguyen): Closed internal ticket after customer postmortem delivered and follow-up technical review scheduled for next week. Finance confirmed no additional burst-capacity charges for incident window; goodwill credit handled via CS.
