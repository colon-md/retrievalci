consolidate-sampled-context-anchors-and-cost-delta-annotations

Motivation: Long-tail requests and multi-turn sessions make it hard to correlate expensive tokens with the actual prompt context. Alert noise for cost spikes often stems from superficially similar traces that differ in a few context tokens. This PR introduces two complementary observability primitives: (1) sampled context anchors — compact, privacy-safe snapshots attached to selected traces that let engineers inspect a representative prefix without storing full payloads; and (2) cost-delta annotations — span-level annotations that capture the incremental token cost relative to a baseline (baseline = first N tokens of the session or pinned model variant), enabling per-span cost-attribution and easy identification of regression candidates.

What this change does (high level):
- Adds a lightweight sampled-context store and recorder in the runtime that writes encrypted, k-anonymized anchors for 1% of long-tail sessions (configurable). Anchors include token fingerprints, anonymized prompt length buckets, and hashed prompt-context tags for grouping (no raw PII/token content stored).
- Adds cost-delta annotations into the tracing pipeline: each model-stage span now carries cost.delta and cost.baseline fields (numeric micro-units). These are added as span attributes and surfaced to OTEL and internal trace indexer.
- Dashboard updates: new dashboard panels on Console -> Observability that show per-route cost-delta distribution, anchor-cluster heatmap (session groups), and annotated trace + anchor join views.
- Alert tuning: new alerting rule that groups alerts by anchor-hash first and surfaces a single grouped alert for clusters of similar high-cost traces (reduces noisy duplicates). Added docs and runbook snippets for triage.

Implementation notes and constraints:
- Context anchors are generated at the runtime layer (redwood/service/runtime) before caching/quantization to avoid skew. Anchors emit a deterministic anchor-hash derived from a salted rolling-hash; the salt is customer-scoped to avoid cross-tenant correlation.
- Cost delta math: cost.delta = observed_token_cost - baseline_token_cost, baseline_token_cost is computed using a rolling median of the first 32 tokens for the route/model combo and periodically recomputed by a background aggregator.
- Privacy compliance: anchors are truncated and tokenized into fingerprint sketches; feature flags and customer-level opt-out is supported.
- Performance: profiling showed a 0.2% median p99 added latency on typical requests in our stage perf lab; batching and non-blocking flush paths mitigate the tail impact.

Evan Carter: Left a few inline comments about the anchor hashing entropy. Asked for a short doc explaining how the salt is generated and rotated. Approved after changes.
Luca Marin: Requested an explicit opt-out path for enterprise Private deployments and noted a missing unit test for the indexer join. Verified tests after fix and approved.
Jade Huang: Focused on alert UX; asked for grouping threshold to be configurable from Console. Verified dashboard UX and approved.
Author (Priya Menon): Addressed comments; added salt rotation doc, opt-out flag for private installs, and a test for the indexer join. Responded to Jade with screenshots and added a toggle to the dashboard config.
Added sampled context anchors for long-tail session triage and per-span cost-delta annotations. New Console dashboards for cost-delta distributions and anchor clusters. Alert grouping by anchor-hash to reduce duplicate cost alerts. Feature gate and enterprise opt-out available.
