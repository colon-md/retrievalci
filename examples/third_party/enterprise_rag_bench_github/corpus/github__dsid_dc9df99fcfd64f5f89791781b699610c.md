Smoother autoscaler signal and gateway backpressure for dedicated pools

Summary: Introduces a smoothing layer in the Dedicated Autoscaler and a lightweight backpressure signal propagated from the gateway to fleet controllers. This reduces autoscaler thrash on spiky traffic and gives gateways a controlled way to shed load gracefully against per-pool soft capacity and throughput guarantees.

Motivation: Customers on Dedicated have reported oscillations when short bursts cross autoscaler thresholds and then recede; this leads to unnecessary GPU spin-ups and billing variance, as well as transient error spikes. The gateway currently responds with 429s or fallback heuristics; we need a first-class, observable mechanism that cooperates with autoscaling and preserves headroom for SLA-critical requests.

Changes in this PR:
- Autoscaler: add Exponential Moving Average (EMA) smoothing of utilization and request rate with configurable half-life per-pool. New config fields: smoothing_window_ms, smoothing_alpha (derived).
- Soft capacity & grace tokens: each pool now tracks a small ephemeral token bucket (grace_tokens) to allow short bursts without triggering scale-up, decaying over time and replenished by underutilization.
- Gateway backpressure: add a new X-Redwood-Backpressure header and a compact gRPC/backchannel (gateway->controller) event to advertise desired ingress rate reductions per-route when pool smoothed_utilization > threshold.
- Controller/gateway handshake: gateway subscribes to per-pool backpressure_quota updates; controllers include backpressure_rate in scheduling decisions and expose metrics.
- Telemetry: new metrics smoothed_utilization, grace_tokens_available, backpressure_rate, backpressure_rejections. Add Prometheus labels for pool_id, model_id, and region.
- API schema: extend dedicated pool spec with smoothing and backpressure knobs; added validation and defaults.
- Console/docs: admin UI now surfaces smoothing window and current backpressure state with guidance.
- Tests: unit tests for smoothing math, integration e2e that injects burst traffic and asserts reduced scale-up churn and controlled 429 behavior.

Checklist:
- [x] Design review with SRE and Runtime teams (ENG-2147)
- [x] Unit tests for smoothing and token bucket
- [x] Integration e2e simulating bursty traffic
- [x] Telemetry dashboards updated
- [x] Migration notes and rollout plan
- [x] Backwards-compatible API schema changes (defaults safe)

Implementation notes:
- EMA parameters chosen to have ~30s half-life by default; pools serving low-latency workloads can set shorter windows.
- Grace tokens default to 2 tokens per pool; a token represents ~1s worth of headroom at pool's nominal throughput.
- Backpressure is advisory: scheduler will attempt to respect backpressure_rate before rejecting; only when backpressure persists will the gateway return 429s.
- To avoid unsafe throttling loops, backpressure updates include a monotonic seq and TTL.

Breaking changes: none expected; all new fields are optional with safe defaults.

Rollout plan: staged rollout: 1) feature gated off by default; 2) enable on Canary Dedicated clusters for 48h; 3) enable for opt-in customers with console toggle; 4) enable by default after 2 weeks of stable metrics.

Migration: API customers can ignore new fields; operators upgrading on-prem should ensure controllers and gateway are updated together.

Testing:
- Unit and integration tests added under tests/e2e/dedicated_smoothing_test.go
- Load test harness reproduces 1-2 minute burst profiles and asserts scale-up events reduced by >=50% while 95th-p99 latency impact <5% in our baseline.

- 8a7f6e1: api: add dedicated pool schema changes + validation
- c3e4d5b: telemetry: register new metrics and dashboards
- d4f2a9f: console: show per-pool smoothing/backpressure state

Files changed (high level):
- controller/autoscaler/smoothing.go: implement EMA and smoothing helpers (approx. 220 LOC)
- pkg/allocator/soft_capacity.go: grace tokens and soft capacity decisions
- gateway/backpressure/handler.go: header parsing and backchannel emitter
- api/config/v1/dedicated_pool.yaml: schema additions and docs
- telemetry/metrics_registry.go: new metric registration
- console/src/pages/pool/BackpressureCard.tsx: UI surface
- tests/e2e/dedicated_smoothing_test.go: load test harness
- helm/charts/redwood/templates/pool-config.yaml: default knobs
- ops/rollout/2026-03-dedicated-smoothing.md: rollout instructions

Small illustrative snippets:
- smoothing.go (EMA core): "smoothed = alpha*instant + (1-alpha)*smoothed"
- handler.go (gateway header): "if hdr := req.Header.Get(\"X-Redwood-Backpressure\"); hdr != \"\" { parseAndApply(hdr) }"

CI and checks:
- CI: go build, unit tests, linters (golangci), frontend unit tests
- e2e pipeline run on canary (k8s)
- Initial CI run: failed flakiness in e2e; reran and passed on second attempt.

Review thread summary:
- Marco Alvarez (SRE): requested clearer backpressure-to-scheduler contract and TTL handling. Response: added monotonic seq + TTL and explicit scheduler fallback behavior (controller will not reduce scheduling below 50% of nominal unless pool explicitly marked best-effort).
- Leah Kim (Runtime): asked for benchmark numbers for default EMA half-life; Response: added results from synthetic bursts showing 60% reduction in scale-ups with 30s half-life.
- Owen Patel (Security): requested audit logging for backpressure events; Response: added structured audit logs under telemetry/backpressure_events.
- Reviewer approvals: Marco Alvarez approved after TTL addition; Leah Kim approved after benchmark numbers; Owen Patel approved after audit logs.

Merge and post-merge actions:
- Merge method: squash and merge
- Post-merge: created a follow-up issue to add gauntlet tests against real customer workloads (ENG-2210)
- Updated canary dashboards and set alert: DedicatedPool.SmoothedUtilization > 95% for 5m -> page oncall

Risks and mitigations:
- Risk: misconfigured smoothing window could delay needed scale-ups -> mitigation: default conservative half-life and admin override to disable smoothing per pool.
- Risk: backpressure loops between gateway and controller -> mitigation: monotonic seq + TTL + min-scheduling floor.

Release notes: "Improves autoscaler stability by smoothing utilization signals and introduces an advisory backpressure mechanism from gateway to controllers to reduce churn on short bursts. Operators: feature is opt-in and has safe defaults; see admin docs for tuning guidance."

CI status: pass
